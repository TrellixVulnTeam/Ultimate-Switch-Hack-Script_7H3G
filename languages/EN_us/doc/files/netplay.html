In this tutorial we will see how to play online with a banned or not banned console. It should be noted that obviously, this does not pass through Nintendo's official servers, so it is an alternative online mode. To quickly explain how it works, this allows you to use the LAN (local area network) functionality of the games/homebrew switches and redirect traffic to a server that will link the players.
<br/><br/>
This tutorial works regardless of the console firmware and besides, it is not even necessary to use a CFW if of course you own the game officially. It is also preferable to have the latest update of the game played.
<br/><br/>
Note: You can even play online with Retroarch, this will please a lot of people I'm sure. 
<br/><br/>
First, you must configure the internet settings of the Switch: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass the IP address in static.</li>
<li>Enter an IP address from "10.13.0.1" to "10.13.255.254" (the address "10.13.37.1" cannot be used because it is the gateway). Be careful, do not use the same IP as one of your friends.</li>
<li>The subnet mask must be "255.255.0.0.0".</li>
<li>The gateway must therefore be "10.13.37.1".</li>
<li>Switch the DNS to manual and enter the addresses "8.8.8.8" and "4.4.4.4" for banned consoles (in my opinion we can even use the DNS of our Internet provider or other DNS for that matter and it will work very well) and for consoles that are not banned, use the addresses "163.172.141.219" and "45.248.48.62" and there they should be used to prevent telemetry info from being sent to Nintendo.</li>
<li>Save the settings.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p>
Then launch the script and choose the option to Launch the client to be able to play on the network.
<br/><br/>
If this has never been done, you will have to choose the option to install Winpcap and complete the installation of it. Once this is done, this is no longer necessary unless an update of Winpcap is released. 
<br/><br/>
Once this is done, choose the option to launch the client. A new window will open in which you must first enter one of the available servers and then press "Enter". The available public servers are noted at the end of this page. 
<br/><br/>
Note: To exit the client, simply click on the shortcut "ctrl+c". 
<br/><br/>
It is also possible to create a server yourself but this will not be processed here for the moment, see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spacemeowx2/switch-lan-play">the Github readme</a> for instructions.
<br/><br/>
Now you will have to enter the number of the network interface to use. To know which one to enter, the IP address used by the PC must be the one that connects to the Internet and it must also be on the same network as the Switch (connected to the same router). To find it, make the keyboard shortcut "Windows+r key", type "cmd", press "Enter", type "ipconfig" in the window that will open and the different information will be displayed. It is therefore necessary to find the IP address that connects to the Internet, it will probably be the first one displayed in the list or otherwise, it will probably be the one that has as gateway "192.168.1.1.1" or "192.168.1.254" or "192.168.0.1" or "192.168.0.254" (afterwards, it depends on the internet configuration of each one). If you can't find it, try each of the proposed interfaces until the Switch connects to the Internet. 
<br/><br/>
Then connect the Switch to the Internet and check that it is a full access to it. 
<br/><br/>
Launch the game, go into the online game, position yourself on the Wifi option and hold "L+R+LStick" (the handling may be different depending on the game). 
<br/><br/>
Finally, create or join a game and have fun.
