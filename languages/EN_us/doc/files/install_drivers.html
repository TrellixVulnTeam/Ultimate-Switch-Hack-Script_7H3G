<h1>Driver installation</h1>
&nbsp;
<p>
You can choose these different options via the "Functions to be used occasionally" menu and then "Install drivers for the Switch". 
</p>
<h2>Installation of the RCM mode driver</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>
The RCM mode must be started and the Switch must be connected to the computer before performing one of the installations shown bellow.
</p>
&nbsp;
<h3>Automatic mode</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>
This is the first option and the one I recommend to install this driver. All you have to do is make this choice, accept the privilege increase request that will eventually appear and follow the instructions on the screen in the window that will open. 
</p>
&nbsp;
<h3>Via Zadig</h3>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Select the installation via Zadig and accept the privilege increase request that may appear.</li>
<li>In the menu bar, click on "Options" then on "List All Devices".</li>
<li>In the list at the top of the screen, select "APX" and in the "WCID" section, select "libusbK (v3.0.7.0.0)" (the version may be different) using the "+" button next to it.</li>
<li>Finally, click on "Install drivers" or "Replace Driver".</li>
<li>Once the driver is installed, Zadig can be closed.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Via the device manager</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>
It is possible that the labels I indicate for the different buttons are a little different depending on the version of Windows used, the ones I indicate here are for Windows 7. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the installation via the device manager.</li>
<li>Normally, a device named "APX" in the "other devices" section should have a yellow exclamation point, sinifying that the driver is not installed. Right-click on it and click on "Update driver...".</li>
<li>In the window that will open, click on "Search for a driver on my computer".</li>
<li>On the next screen, click on the "Browse..." button and go to the "tools\drivers\manual_installation_usb_driver" folder in this script. It is also preferable to check the box "Include subfolders".</li>
<li>Once the configuration is complete, click on the "Next" button and the driver should be installed.</li>
<li>Click on the "Finish" button and close the device manager.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>Installation of the libnx_USB_comms mode driver</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>
Tinfoil or Awoo-Installer or Goldleaf must be started and the Switch must be connected to the computer before performing one of the installations shown. The Switch screen should also remain on during the procedure. 
</p>
&nbsp;
